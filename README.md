Powertop Analysis/Plotting Tools
================================

A small set of python scripts to analyse csv files generated by
PowerTOP[1]. For example recording data for ~33 minutes, a new
sample every 5 seconds is done via:

    powertop -C <name> -i 400 -t 5

The raw data is processed into more nicely consumable csv data
by `pt-analyse.py`:

    pt-analyse.py <datafolder> <name>

This will produce two csv files, one for the device statistics,
`<name>-device.csv`, and one for the software/processes,
`<name>-process.csv`,. Each of them can be plotted with the
`pt-plot.py` tool, e.g. process information:

    pt-plot.py <name>-process.csv

Saving the plots can be done with the `--save` command line option.
